# SIC Assembler - Pass 1

## This is the Pass 1 of a SIC (Simplified Instructional Computer) assembler implemented in C. The program performs the first pass over the assembly code to generate the symbol table, detect labels, and calculate addresses.
## Features
    1. Reads SIC assembly code from an input file.
    2. Creates a symbol table with labels and their corresponding addresses.
    3. Calculates addresses for each instruction and stores them for Pass 2.
    4. Detects errors such as duplicate labels and invalid instructions.
